# Heading Level 1

This is body text following an h1. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Here's some `inline code` and inline math $E = mc^2$ to show sizing.

## Heading Level 2

This is body text following an h2. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Here's more `inline code` and math $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$ inline.

### Heading Level 3

This is body text following an h3. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

#### Heading Level 4

This is body text following an h4. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris.

##### Heading Level 5

This is body text following an h5. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore.

###### Heading Level 6

This is body text following an h6. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

Welcome to my blog! This is a test post demonstrating all the features.

# Math Support

Here's an inline equation: $E = mc^2$.

And a block equation showing Maxwell's first equation:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

Here's the softmax function commonly used in machine learning:

$$
\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{x_j}}
$$

# Code

`inline code` Here's some Python code:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

# A simple neural network layer
class Linear:
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        self.weight = np.random.randn(in_features, out_features)
        self.bias = np.zeros(out_features)

    def forward(self, x):
        return x @ self.weight + self.bias
```

And some TypeScript:

```typescript
interface Post {
  title: string;
  pubDate: Date;
  tags: string[];
}

const formatDate = (date: Date): string => {
  return date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
    year: 'numeric',
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric'
  });
};
```

# Typography

This paragraph demonstrates the clean, reader-focused typography inspired by [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/). Notice the generous line height, comfortable font size, and optimal line width for reading.

> A blockquote adds visual variety and helps break up long passages of text. This style is intentionally understated.

## Lists

Here are some things I'm interested in:

- Deep learning and neural network optimization
- Programming language theory and type systems
- Immunology and autoimmune disease research
- Open source software and the NixOS ecosystem

And a numbered list:

1. First, understand the problem
2. Then, design a solution
3. Finally, implement and iterate
